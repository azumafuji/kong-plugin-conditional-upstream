# conditional-upstream Kong plugin 

This plugin allows definition of rules to set a new upstream URL based on specifying a header and value. Additional planned features are conditional upstream based on consumer and API similar to [kong-dynamic-upstream](https://github.com/nvmlabs/kong-dynamic-upstream). 

## ToDo
- [ ] initial implementation based on header:value pairs including persistence and API support
- [ ] full test suite 
- [ ] documentation
- [ ] add consumer based conditional upstream
